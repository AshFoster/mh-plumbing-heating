## User Experience (UX)

The five planes of user experience were considered during the design phase of this website, which are all outlined below.

### Strategy Plane

Here, the user goals are considered and outlined with the aim of having a clear understanding of what thought process user's of the site are likely to go through, and what they might expect from the website.

The website's owner's goals are also be considered, and when combined with the user goals, will provide ideas for potential features for the website.

  - to see images of the sort of work the company has done previously. 
  - easily be able to find out how to make contact with the company.
  - see the general area the company provides its services to.

- __Owner Goals__
  
  As the owner I would like:

  - the users of my website to have planty of calls to action.
  - the users to be prompted to make contact to ask any questions they may have or to request a quote for some work they require.

### Structure Plane




## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar will always be visible to the user. It will have the company's logo shown on the left hand side which, when clicked, will return the user to the home/landing page. On the right hand side it will have links to the differnt sections of the site. It will be fully responsive showing a hamburger menu icon on smaller screens which, when clicked, will show/hide the list of the site's navigation links, whilst on larger screens the hamburger icon will dissapear and the site's navigation links will be shown as a horizontal list across the navigation bar.
  - The purpose of this section is to allow the user to easily navigate between the different parts of the site no matter which section they are currenlty viewing.

- __Home/Landing Page__

  - The home/landing page will have a background image of a nicely done bathroom with an overlay of text and a button. Both will be eye catching, with the overall aim of immediately letting the user know what the site is about. The button will be a call to action which, when clicked, will take the user to the contact us form.
  - This section will be fully reponsive across all device sizes, and will always be shown in its entirety, so all of the text and the button will be immediately visible on all devices. N.B. I have yet to find a really efficient way of implementing this functionality with my current knowledge of HTML and CSS - I'm currently using many media queries which all need updating if the font size or font family, to name a few, are changed. Not ideal for future maintainability. 

- __About Us Section__

  - The about us section will allow the user to find out more about the company itself, and its staff's previous experences. It will have some text describing this and will show an image of the company's van.
  - This section is aimed at instilling confidence in the user which should encourage them to consider contacting the company to request some work.
